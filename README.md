### Project Synopsis
Educe.club is a personal insights platform designed to help lifelong learners capture, organize, and act on the knowledge they consume. Founded by knowledge management experts Michael Thaney and Tony Kunkel, the platform addresses the gap between enterprise knowledge management solutions and consumer technology. While people spend countless hours reading, listening, and watching content, much of it is forgotten. Educe.club changes that by making insight capture seamless, searchable, and shareable.

Educe is currently a web application leveraging React and an AWS stack, supporting basic insight creation, classification, and sharing. Educe currently has an active beta user base which has generated feedback creating a prioritized feature roadmap. During this year,  we hope to improve the user experience, enhance insight creation (with source linking), expand public vs. private sharing, and launch a non-authenticated landing page showcasing trending insights. Other major initiatives include a “reader view” for playlist-like interaction, integrations with platforms such as X (f.k.a. Twitter), an analytics dashboard, and AI-driven insight suggestions.
